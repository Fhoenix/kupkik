 - inluce appengine-web.xml but read value for <application> from other file (which is not included in repository, because its different for each user)

 - maven build
 	- requirements:
 		- project must build
 		- must be able to build and deploy from eclipse 
 			- (either by using gae-plugin or by using maven-plugin or something else, but it should not be necessary to open a console for build/deployment)
 		- must be able to handle packages being in different projects
 	- recommended way of implementing maven build:
 		1) create a basic maven google app engine project which uses jsp and servlets
 		2) make it possible to deploy that project
 		3) find a way to save the credentials in a different file (which will not be committed to GIT) and possibly encrypt them
 		4) make it possible to create an eclipse project from that basic project
 		5) make it possible to build the project from eclipse without having to use the console
 		6) make it possible to deploy the project from eclipse without having to use the console
 		7) Create another project which defines a class. The basic project uses this class from the other project. It is also used in the JSP. Building and deployment should still work.
 		8) Now all challenges have been overcome. Migrate kupkik to that basic project.
 		9) Test that kupkik still builds and deploys.
 		10) check it in
